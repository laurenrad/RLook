RLook is an application to browse sample disk images for Roland 12-bit samplers.
This is a preview release; documentation is incomplete. However, here are some
basic points:
    - This is currently read-only. The ability to edit disks may be added in
      the future, but this is an ambitious idea, so not sure.
    - Currently only S-550 disk images are supported. The backend also
      supports S-50 and S-330 disk images, but this is not implemented
      fully yet.
    - This requires the riscos_toolbox module for Python3. Install with pip 	      
      using `python3 -m pip install riscos_toolbox
    - RLook also currently requires PlayIt 1.73 to be installed, which
      can be obtained here:
	  	http://www.riscos-digitalcd.net/digitalcd/player/download.htm

    - RLook is released under the MIT License. See LICENCE file for details.
    - RLook was developed as a demonstration of the capabilities of the
	  riscos_toolbox, but not best practices. It's sort of a mess right now.
    - A sample disk "DEV/OUT" is included from Roland's RSB library, which is
      believed to be in the public domain. More can be obtained online, such
      as at: llamamusic.com/s50s550/unusual_samples.html#S55060
